# chatterbox-client
This is a redo of week 3, day 1-2 from hackreactor

## My Recollection
I believe the server side of the code is given.
I think the task was to create the front-end side of the chatroom using ajax.

## Update
I am unable to work on the client, because no server is provided (we were provided one).
My task now is to create the server.

## Update 2
Server is now functioning locally. On to the todos! I've finished most of the tests.
A lot of the features are not on the todos though, so I'll have to gauge them.

## Estimated Todos:
- [x] finish specs
- [x] room feature
- [x] chat feature
- [ ] more friend feature

## What I (re)learned:
- ajax calls
- basic jquery manipulation
- spaghetti code sucks
