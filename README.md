# chatterbox-client
This is a redo of week 3, day 1-2 from hackreactor

## My Recollection
I believe the server side of the code is given.  
I think the task was to create the front-end side of the chatroom using ajax.

## Update
I am unable to work on the client, because no server is provided (we were provided one).  
My task now is to create the server.
